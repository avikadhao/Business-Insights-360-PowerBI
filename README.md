📊 Business Insights 360 – Power BI Project
🚀 Overview

Business Insights 360 is an end-to-end Power BI analytics dashboard designed to give a complete view of business performance across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive leadership.

Built using 1.8M+ rows of business data, this project focuses on turning raw, complex data into clear insights that support real business decisions.

This project was created as part of my learning journey to gain hands-on experience with real-world business analytics.

🧠 Why This Project Matters

Many organizations still rely heavily on Excel, which becomes inefficient when data grows large and decisions need to be fast.

This project addresses challenges such as:

Limited visibility into profitability and growth

Difficulty tracking customer and product performance

Poor forecasting visibility in supply chain operations

Lack of a single, unified business view

Business Insights 360 solves these problems by bringing all key metrics into one interactive dashboard.
